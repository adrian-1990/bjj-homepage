            <h3>Brazilian JiuJitsu</h3>
            <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu(BJJ) is a martial art based on ground fighting and submission holds.
            It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.<br>
            BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend him/herself against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them.
