            <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu(BJJ) is a martial art based on ground fighting and submission holds.
            It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.<br>
            BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend him/herself against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them.
            <br>All our classes are taught by black belts and have years of experience competing in local and international competitions.

            <p>Nogi jiujitsu incorporates all differant grappling styles, BJJ / Judo / Wrestling / Sambo.<br>
            Nogi is a faster pace style of grappling as you do not have material to grip and control your opponent, unlike BJJ and Judo.<br>
            In the last couple of years there has been a massive revolution in nogi grappling due to the rise in leg locks. Our instructors have spent time with the travelling and learning these new techniques and are excitied to pass on this knowledge.
            <br> Our instructors have competed on some of the biggest stages in nogi grappling such as ADCC, EBI and Polaris.
