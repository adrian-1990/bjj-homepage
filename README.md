## Design process

I created my initial deisgn on wireframe to get a feel for the deisgn and layout. I initially wanted to do a single page with four differant sections but as my design evolved I amended it to four pages. 
I wanted the site to be easy to use for first time visitors but also to encourage return visits. I wanted to site to have easy navigation on PC, tablets and mobiles for first time visitors and if I'm a return visitor and I'm interested in the club I can make contact through social media.

Below are the design ideas I had before eventully settling on my current design.

#### Design 1 
![BJJ Wireframe layout 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144373892-66e070a6-c7b5-4075-8c54-57059cc16ce0.png)

#### Design 2

![BJJ wireframe Classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144374252-b48502f8-6f50-4ebe-89de-fd9e1b144753.png)
![BJJ Wireframe Timetable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144374269-d93772fc-d673-44ef-b312-cdf3dfc2974c.png)
![BJJ Wireframe Contact Us](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144374289-f6c1fdb0-8041-4fc8-90f3-4dcb24d0ba8c.png)


### Typography

I chose two fonts for the page. I chose **"Cairo"** as my font for headings with sans-serif as back up if it does not load. For my paragraphs / timetable body / forms I have use the font **"Mohave"** with sans-serif as back up.

* I feel these two fonts give the page a clean and modern look and provide a positive user experience.

### Color scheme

The color scheme uses a minimal pallet and gets the majority of color from my images on the page. When you hover over interactive links they change color to bring your attention to them and to encourage you to explore.

The colors I used were:
* lightgrey
* rgb(228, 58, 58)
* black

### Imagery

All the images used on the site were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/judo). This site allows you to download images for free. I wanted the images to display people practicing BJJ / No-gi grappling so visitors to the site would get an idea of what the club offered and encourage a return visit to learn more.
The images used on the site were quite large so I compressed them using [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/).


## Site Structure.

The site consists of four pages:
* Homepage
* Classes
* Timetable
* Contact-us

The navbar and footer will be present on all pages. This will allow the user to easily navigate the site and to get in contact via social media.

### Landing page.

This is the default page when people visit the site. There will be a header element with the club logo and nav elements. A main image of people training BJJ. 3 links to the other pages on the site and the footer at the end.

When you land on the page you first see the navbar and a large image of people training BJJ. This will let the site user know how they can naviagate the site and give them an idea of what the club offers. As a first time visitor you will have how to navigate the site and the image is relevent to what the club offer and provide a positive user experience.

![welcome-section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144607551-80567aee-3154-4735-8fb3-ec91756f90a9.png)


As you scoll down you encounter the welcome text. This is a brief description about what the club offers. It has a description of the facilites, instructors and the club ethos.

![welcome-text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144599886-4dab3c38-dfb1-4c9e-9f66-fdf46d2cb465.png)


As you scroll down the page you come to a section with three images and links to other sections of the page. On a PC or laptop when the user hovers over the text under the images they will change color to let the user know they can be interacted with and encourage the user to click the links and find out more about what the club has to offer.

![page-links](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144599615-9a8a0d92-f975-4aa9-be9c-52afad94b9ff.png)

At the end of the page is the footer with the links to our social media links. Again these change color when hover over to encourage interaction.

![footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144599646-200be01c-5074-410b-86a8-42b347a85c8d.png)

### Classes page.

This page contains the classes offered and a brief description of each class. There is an image of the class type to give a visual idea of the classes.

### Timetable

This page has the timetable which displays what days and times the classes are on.

![timetable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144608252-9ff3a960-2fad-49fb-bba2-a6349b7bc462.png)


There is a description of the classes underneath the timetable so the user knows what is expected in each class.

![timetable-classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144608445-4e4ee297-8aa4-4ef1-8d91-299a18fd2f5a.png)

New user can find out about the times classes are running and return users can learn about the advance classes as the progress on their grappling journey. This section will also provide all the info required for guests who wish to visit the club. This should give a positive experience for new and return users.

I used [W3School Table](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) for guidance when creating the timetable.


### Contact Us

Users can complete the form and make contact with the club to ask whatever questions the have. 

![contact-form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/144609682-b6d0f5e8-b15b-4c0c-9aff-d8c85f16857c.png)

A video at the end of the page shows BJJ highlights and shows the user what BJJ is about. This will provide a positive experience for the user and encourage them to sign up.

## Future features

Below are a list of features I would like to add to the site to improve user experience and encourage return visits to the site.

* Club shop
  * I would like to create a club shop where members would be able to buy club merchendise (t-shirts, hoodies, stickers etc.)

* Burger menu
  * I would like to create a burger menu for mobile and smaller screen sizes. I feel this would clean up the navbar and improve the user experience.

* Testimonials
  * I would like to create a slideshow showing members testimonials and their experience.

# Technologies Used

  * This was the main language used in creating the website

* CSS
  * This was used to style the website

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  * Font awesome was used for theicon images on the footer

# Testing

## HTML Testing

I tested my HTML in [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## CSS Testing

I tested my CSS in [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Lighthouse Testing

### Error

* When I tested my webpage page my site was failing on performence. This was because the images on the site were to large and taking a long time to upload.

 ![lighthouse test (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/143593501-f9058ba4-41da-48b9-94ba-e3e278d56a59.png)

### Solution

* I resized my images through https://tinypng.com/ and replaced all the larger sized images with the new smaller sized images. This improved performence and reduced delays in the page uploading.

![lighthouse bug fixed (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/143593858-521c7566-ced7-4359-a35e-cbf4f7641b7c.png)

## Bugs Found

### Navbar

When I was resizing the page and width dropped below 1080 px the sequence of my navbar went out of sequence.

![Bug on my header page (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79532281/143681092-0e13e548-fb35-483b-a7dc-03a09b681b90.jpg)

To fix this but I amended the display to inline flex, changed the direction to reverse.

# Deployment

### Project Creation

The project was created by using Github and Gitpod pages. I created the code through Gitpod pages and then backed them up to Github. This allowed me to create a live site via Github.
**To deploy the project**

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy the site are:
1. In the Github repository, select the **Settings** tab.
2. Once in the setting, select the **Pages** tab on the left hand side.
3. Under **Source**, select the branch to master, then click **save**.
4. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will automatically create a link for your site.
